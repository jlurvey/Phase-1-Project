The page initially loads displaying all 32 NHL teams in alphabetical order along with their First Year of Play, Conference, Division, Venue, and a live link to the official team website. There is a filter form, a sort by drop down at the top of the page. The sort by dropdown will sort all displayed teams by the option displayed selected in the box. After sorting, the reset button will reset the page to it's original sort order. The filter form will take a text string, displaying all those teams that have any of their properties, including name and abbreviation. Sorting after the list is filtered will only sort the displayed teams. Filtering the list after the list is filtered will only filter the displayed teams. To reset the filtered list, we can click the reset button.
